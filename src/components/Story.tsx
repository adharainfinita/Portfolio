					A long time ago...

						I had lived a complete different live. Inside, It's was me, with my
						dreams, my thoughts, feelings and desires{" "}
						<p className=" inline-flex font-bold text-ciel mr-1">but</p>
						all things were lost in material reality. I didn't see my body, I
						didn't feel it. And without the body, the mind cannot{" "}
						<p className=" inline-flex font-bold text-ciel mr-1">fly</p>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I always felt interest in science and knowledge. I went the UBA
						university, in Buenos Aires where i learned a lot of things about
						the social and the human like specy. After a{" "}
						<p className=" inline-flex font-bold text-ciel">crisis</p>, I
						dropped out of college and entered the world of technology. I wanted
						to create virtual things, understand how they worked, how it was
						possible, but above all, express everything that exists in the
						darkness of the mind. Philosophy embraced me and although I almost {" "}
						<p className=" inline-flex font-bold text-ciel mr-1">lost</p>my mind
						because of it, the pandemic came and finally I tried programming.
					</p>
					<p className=" inline-flex text-detail mr-1">
						Now, I feel complete with poetry and programming. I can feel the power
							of letters, of a code, build the world, change things
						, and above all, improve the living conditions of people who have
						come into the world with bad cards.
